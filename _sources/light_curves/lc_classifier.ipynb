    "# Light Curve Classifier\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- do some basic data cleaning and filtering to prepare the data for the ML algorithms\n",
    "- work with Pandas data frames as a way of storing time domain datasets\n",
    "- use sktime algorithms to train a classifier and predict values on a test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook takes output of a previous demo notebook which generates light curves from archival data, does data prep, and runs the light curves through multiple [`sktime`](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/) classifiers.  The goal of the classifiers is to be able to differentiate changing look active galactic nucleii (CLAGN) from an SDSS quasar sample based on multiband light curves.  CLAGN are quite interested objects in that they appear to change state, but only a few hundred are currently known, and finding them is quite expensive requiring spectroscopic follow up.  Being able to identify CLAGN in existing large samples would allow us to identify a statisitcal sample from which we could better understand the physics of what is occuring in these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges of this time-domain dataset are:\n",
    "1. Multi-variate = There are multiple bands of observations per target (13+)\n",
    "2. Unequal length = Each band has a light curve with different sampling than other bands\n",
    "3. Missing data = Not each object has all observations in all bands\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to use a Pandas multiindex dataframe to store and work with the data because it fulfills these requirements:\n",
    "1. It can handle the above challenges of a dataset = multi-variate, unqueal length with missing data.\n",
    "2. Multiple targets (multiple rows)\n",
    "3. Pandas has some built in understanding of time units\n",
    "4. Can be scaled up to big data numbers of rows (altough we don't push to out of memory structures in this use case)\n",
    "5. Pandas is user friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "Light curve parquet file of multiband light curves from the mulitband_lc.ipynb demo notebook.  The format of the light curves is a Pandas multiindex data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful reference for what sktime expects as input to its ML algorithms: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "Trained classifiers as well as estimates of their accuracy and plots of confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "- `pandas` to work with light curve data structure\n",
    "- `numpy` for numerical calculations\n",
    "- `matplotlib` for plotting\n",
    "- `sys` for paths\n",
    "- `astropy` to work with coordinates/units and data structures\n",
    "- `tqdm` for showing progress meter\n",

    "This classifier can be used to predict CLAGN.  The feature based algorithms do the best jobs of having little to no predicted CLAGN that are truly normal SDSS quasars.  We infer then that if the trained model predicts CLAGN, it is a very good target for follow-up spectroscopy to confirm CLAGN.  However this algorthim will not catch all CLAGN, and will incorrectly labels some CLAGN as being normal SDSS quasars.  THis algorithm can therefore not be used to find a complete sample of CLAGN, but can be used to increase the known sample."
